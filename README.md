# Options-Pricing-and-Sensitivity-Analysis-Tool
This Python program is designed to calculate the price of a European option using two different pricing models: the Black-Scholes 
option pricing model and the binomial option pricing model. The program prompts the user to enter whether they want to price a 
call or put option, and then calculates and displays the option prices for varying levels of volatility. The binomial option pricing 
model uses the binomial tree to calculate the option price, while the Black-Scholes option pricing model uses the Black-Scholes 
stochastic differential equation and NumPy libraries. The program also includes a function to calculate the normal cumulative distribution function, 
which is used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The results are displayed in a table using the tabulate library.
